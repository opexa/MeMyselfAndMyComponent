    <h2>Hello,</h2>
    <h3>I am Nikola Katrandzhiev.</h3>

    <p>I am an 18 years old boy from Varna, Bulgaria. <br/> Since I was fifteen I'm exploring new horizonts in the world of web development.</p>
    <p>To me the Goodbag project looks like something I would love to work on, because I like innovative and entrepreneurial projects and your bag looks like one for sure. <br/> Technical wise I use ReactJS in many of my own projects. I've been using both Flux and Redux in past and current projects.</p>

    <p><i>Thank you for your time.</i></p> 
    <p><i> Kind Regards, <br/>Nikola</i></p>
  </div>
